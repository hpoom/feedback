# hpoom/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from 
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and seems like a pretty fantastic 
idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

I talk at meetups and conferences about many aspects of the web and web development. I also [blog](http://hpoom.co.uk/) about 
web development because I love talking and discussing technology. So If you have any questions
about about one of my talks, my views on the internet and web development, or questions about
me in general, send them this way... I would be happy to answer them.

If you have any technical problems with one of my other git repositories, you are best to raise an issue under the appropriate repository.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/hpoom/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/hpoom/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@hpoom](https://twitter.com/hpoom) on
Twitter.
